I'm a fun-loving geek driven to create things (almost everything in code) almost as much as I am called to teach others how to do it themselves. I enjoy diving into data and have been known to get lost in JS and it's vast application's at times. I'm passionate about clean codebase, purposeful interfaces and joyous user experiences. I does read lots of books, but few. I'm a stressed coder, living human, and engineer by chance.
